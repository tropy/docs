## Creating a new template

There are several steps to creating a new template. When you first open the Preferences pane, New Template will be the default, but if you click over to one of the other templates, you can get back to New Template by clicking on it in the Template drop-down box or by clicking the first button next to the drop-down.

### Metadata about your template![](/assets/template-header@2x.png)

Your template starts with metadata about the template.

Each template requires a name and a URI at minimum. The creator and description are optional but valuable if you ever intend to share the template you create.

* **Name**: You can name your template anything. We recommend that you name it with as much specificity as possible. For instance, it's likely that you're creating a template to deal with materials from one particular institution, so it makes sense to name your template with the name of the institution. If you're working with one particular collection with unique metadata, name your template after the collection. For example, "National Archives" might be sufficient, or you might want to call your template "National Archives RG 45" if your template would have to be revised in order to fit other record groups at the National Archives.

* **URI**: The URI has to be a unique term within your Tropy installation. We recommend, however, that you think of the URI in broader terms: if you ever intend to share it, you should give it a URI that will be unique no matter where it goes. Templates that come with Tropy, for instance, have URIs that look like this: `https://tropy.org/v1/templates/[name of template]`. If you have a domain that belongs to you, it might make sense for you to give your Tropy templates URIs connected to your web domain. But you could also give your template a URI as basic as "national-archives" or "us-NatArch."

* **Type**: At this time, you should only use the Tropy Item type, which is the default.

* **Creator**: For individuals, the creator should be your name. If you are creating a template on behalf of an institution, we recommend that you assign the institution as creator rather than an individual. For example, if a staff member at the American Antiquarian Society made a template for a collection, the creator should be "American Antiquarian Society."

* **Description**: A short one- or two-sentence statement about the purpose of the template would be useful here; for example, if it is targeted at a particular collection, you could record which collection or collections would work best with the template.

Once you have filled out all the appropriate fields, click on Create 

### Creating new fields in your template

Now that you have the metadata about your template, you can create fields in your template. 

![](/assets/template-fields@2x.png)Tropy currently only allows fields that have URIs in an existing metadata schema. This means that if you have no familiarity with metadata schemas, you are much better off working with an existing template rather than trying to create your own from scratch.

* **Property**: The drop-down box here allows you to select from a list of properties that appear in various metadata schemas. The Dublin core fields are the default; you can add other metadata schemas in the Vocabulary section in Preferences.
