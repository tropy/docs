## Export from Tropy

Tropy items can be exported as [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), as well as to [Omeka S](http://omeka.org/s/) and CVS via plugins.

### To JSON-LD

To export from Tropy, right-click on an item in the item table. From the right-click menu, select _Export Item &gt; JSON-LD_. This action will open a dialog box, where you can save your JSON file onto your computer. To export multiple items, Ctrl/Command+click or Shift+click to select multiple items. Then right-click and select _Export Selected Items_.

At present, Tropy only exports metadata to JSON-LD, not associated photos. Your photos still exist outside Tropy as well, since importing in Tropy copies your photos.
